## 🚀 What I Do
- Full-stack & mobile development  
- Real-time systems (tracking, maps, Supabase… all the spicy stuff)  
- Sports tech nerd: Football, F1, cricket  
- Build things that actually work, not just “compile successfully”

---

## 🧠 Speed Stats That Should Be Illegal
- Sudoku: **~52–56 seconds**  
- Rubik’s Cube: **48 seconds**  
- 8-Puzzle: **8–12 seconds average** (3 seconds personal flex moment)

If debugging was an Olympic sport, I’d take silver. Gold goes to whoever wrote the bug.

- Sergio Ramos is forever  
- Valverde & Asensio enjoyer  
- F1: Max fan
